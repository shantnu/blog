    "I am the Moo-Inator. I come from the future."<br>
    <br>
    "And what happens in the future?" you ask.<br>
    <br>
    "Terrible things. Horrible things. The prices of onions will go
    through the roof. Kids will no longer respect their parents. And oh
    yeah. Evil zombie bankers will destroy civilization."<br>
    <br>
    "Oh my SpongeBob Squarepants!" you shout (as you are an agnostic).
    "Children will no longer respect their parents? Those little
    rascals. Next time I see those damn kids, I will tell them to get
    off my lawn." You scratch your butt. "What was that about zombie
    bankers?"<br>
    <br>
    "This year, the Crooks R Us Bank will create a Golden Computer. It
    will be the One. The Golden Laptop will be able to rule all other
    computers, and bring the world to an end. Also, something about
    zombies. Anyway, there is a message on the Golden Lap, written in a
    language so foul, I won't repeat it here. It says:<br>
    <br>
    "One laptop to rule them all,<br>
    One laptop to bring them together,<br>
    and with the power of COBOL,<br>
    bind them.<br>
    One Laptop to Rule them All."<br>
    <br>
    "Okay," you say. "Thanks for the info dump. But why are you telling
    me all this?"<br>
    <br>
    "That's simple. Because you are a wizard, Harry. And you have the
    power to..."<br>
    <br>
    "Wait, wait. My name isn't Harry. It's Dr Underpants."<br>
    <br>
    "What? Let me talk to my agent."<br>
    <br>
    Moo-Inator took out his phone and started talking. After a few
    minutes, he returned.<br>
    <br>
    "It seems I am in the wrong story. But my agent tells me this is the
    only place that will pay me, so here I am. Underpants, I have a
    shocking secret for you."<br>
    <br>
    "What?"<br>
    <br>
    "Underpants, you a geek."<br>
    <br>
    "Wait, what? No, that can't be."<br>
    <br>
    "Yes, it is. Not only that, you are the Chosen One Geek. You must
    defeat the Evil Lord, He Who Can Be Named, But Whose Name We Have
    Forgotten."<br>
    <br>
    "What's his name?" you ask.<br>
    <br>
    "Don't know. I've forgotten."<br>
    <br>
    "So how can I defeat him?"<br>
    <br>
    "Using the power of Python, of course."<br>
    <br>
    "But I don't know Python," you say.<br>
    <br>
    "That's fine. Since you are the Chosen One, you can learn any skill
    and master it faster than people who have been it doing it for
    years. Tell me, Underpants. Do you have a cloud shaped scar on your
    posterior?"<br>
    <br>
    "Yes," you say. "I was drunk, and collapsed."<br>
    <br>
    "No!" Cow-Inators vehemence shocks you. "That scar was given to you
    by the dark lord. He also killed you parents, and you must avenge
    them!"<br>
    <br>
    "My parents are still alive. They run a bakery in Aberdeen."<br>
    <br>
    "He killed your parents, and you must avenge them!"<br>
    <br>
    You decide not to argue with him, as its clear the cow is crazy.<br>
    <br>
    The Cow-Inator puts on his cool sun glasses. "Anyway, you need to
    come with me, if you want to live. Also, I have a buy one get one
    free voucher for Cheap Burgers, and we can really go wild. I'll even
    buy us Freedom Fries."<br>
    <br>
    "Before we go crazy in Cheap Burgers, I have to call my boss."<br>
    <br>
    "Okay."<br>
    <br>
    You find a pay phone (because you live in the 80s, and mobile phones
    haven't been invented yet), and make a call. Your boss seems
    worried.<br>
    <br>
    "Underpants. Where are you? I am beginning to get worried."<br>
    <br>
    "Something is wrong," you say. "He is never this nice." <br>
    <br>
    In the background, you can hear your pet donkey braying.<br>
    <br>
    The Moo-Inator takes the phone from you. "What's the donkey's name?"<br>
    <br>
    &lt;code&gt;<br>
    <br>
    #<br>
    <br>
    You enter Crooks R Us Bank. The place is full, and you see a sign in
    front of you.<br>
    <br>
    "Crooks R Us Bank. Where we love our customers so much, we will have
    sex with them. Now give us your freakin' money."<br>
    <br>
    You see something more worrying. A bunch of robbers are in the
    place, and they are robbing the customers. They aren't touching the
    bank employees, for some reason. You run to a bank teller.<br>
    <br>
    "Have you called the police?"<br>
    <br>
    "Why should I?"<br>
    <br>
    "Cause of all these robbers, you know?"<br>
    <br>
    The bank teller picks his nose. "So? We have a professional
    agreement with the robbers. They don't rob us, we don't rob them.
    Professional courtesy."<br>
    <br>
    "At least call the police," you say.<br>
    <br>
    "Why should I?"<br>
    <br>
    The Moo-Inator looks into the teller's window. "I'll be back."<br>
    <br>
    In&nbsp; a whisper, he adds, "Really have to go to the toilet."<br>
    <br>
    He returns five minutes later, and smashes through the window. He is
    carrying a big gun, and starts blowing the robbers away. All the
    robbers run towards him.<br>
    <br>
    &lt;code&gt;<br>
    <br>
    #<br>
    <br>
    The robbers are lying dead on the floor. The Moo-Inator walks
    towards a scared bank employee. "Where is the One Laptop? The one
    with the Power to Rule them All?"<br>
    <br>
    "Don't know man. Maybe top floor. That's where all the big bosses
    are."<br>
    <br>
    You walk up the stairs, only to see a thick manual land at your
    feet. It is followed by a stapler. You realize you are being
    attacked! A motley group of engineers, accountants and lawyers are
    attacking you.<br>
    <br>
    &lt;code&gt;<br>
    <br>
    You reach the top, to find the door locked. Rather than kick the
    door in, like any sane person would do, you decide to use code
    around the lock. Because... well, just because.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    #<br>
    <br>
    "So what do we do with this Golden Laptop? Do we fling it out the
    window?"<br>
    <br>
    "No. This foul device this cannot be destroyed so easily. It must be
    cast back into the fires of Eyjafjallajökull, from whence it was
    created. Any questions?"<br>
    <br>
    "Yes. What does <i>whence </i>mean? And what is&nbsp;
    Eyjafjallajökull?"<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Aside:<br>
    <br>
    Eyjafjallajökull is pronounced Ayah-Fyat-Lah-Yoh-Kuh-Tul. Go on, say
    it a few times. It will make you feel good. Get rid of the tension.
    <br>

    Eyjafjallajökull is the reason Iceland doesn't need an army, not to
    mention the reason the bankers didn't screw over Iceland (Iceland
    was one of few countries that gave the fingers to bankers. Arguing
    rightly that the taxpayers shouldn't have to bail out greedy pigs.
    So why does Eyjafjallajökull save Iceland? Because of this:<br>

    Incidently, Iceland is one of the few countries that confuses even
    Jackie Chan:<br>

    <br>
    "How do we find Iceland," you say.<br>
    <br>
    "Simple. We search for it."<br>
    <br>
    &lt;file open example&gt;<br>
    <br>
    You land in Iceland, to be immediately attacked by a large number of
    Sexy Alien Vampires Who Are Also Zombies (called SAVAAZ from now).
    They were created when many Twilight fans fell into a radioactive
    vat, and were then kidnapped by time traveling aliens. The Twilight
    fans became zombies and bit the aliens, creating the SAVAAZ. And
    now, they all want a piece of you. <br>

    <br>
    One of the best uses of Python is to replace shell scripts- both
    Bash scripts on Linux and (God help us) batch files on Windows.
    Python is a much more powerful language than Bash, it is easier to
    read, and has&nbsp; a lot of good libraries. I would never use a
    shell script now.<br>

    Say you want to run a command on the command line, and capture the
    results. There are many ways to do so, I will show you the one that
    is recommended. [link to stackoverflow answer].<br>
    <br>
    &lt;create file on cmd line. Read its comments. Run wrong command to
    show stderr. Finally, delete file&gt;<br>

    <br>
    You make your way to the mountain. Ayah-fyat-lah-yoh-kuh-tul. You
    know the words, join the song. As you are making your way to the
    fire, a shot rings out. Moo-Inator is knocked out. And out steps the
    main villain- Doggy-Inator.<br>
    <br>
    &lt;Bechara puppy&gt;<br>
    <br>
    "There is only one way to stop him. We must use the Ultimate Weapon.
    One so strong, there is no defence against it. The BFG 9000 Elder
    Wand(Made in China)." <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Doggy-Inator is destroyed. You throw in the One Laptop too.<br>
    <br>
    "It's all over."<br>
    <br>
    "No, it isn't. There is one more chip."<br>
    <br>
    Moo-Inator points at his head. "It too must be destroyed. I cannot
    self destruct. You must lower me into the fire."<br>
    <br>
    You slow lower Moo-Inator into the fire, tears flowing, while
    emotional techno music is playing in the background. The Moo-Inator
    waves you a final goodbye, before being burnt in the flames of
    Eyjafjallajökull.<br>
    <br>
    Just kidding. You don't do any of that. It's happy hour, and you
    have to go drinking with your friends (well, your one imaginary
    friend). So you push Moo-Inator into the volcano, and run to the
    bar.<br>
