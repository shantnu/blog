    <h1 align="center">Which Programming language should you learn?</h1>
    <p>This must be one of the most popular questions for beginner /
      wannabe programmers. Which language should I learn? And if you ask
      a hundred people this question, you will get a hundred and ten
      answers. Now to mention a lot of holy wars, nerd rage, cat fights,
      fist fights; you get the idea.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Many people don't know this, but in 1998 the world almost came to
      the brink of nuclear disaster when a bunch of Visual Basic, C++
      and C programmers broke out into a fist fight. The fight
      escalated, and would have led to a full scale nuclear war, had not
      Linus Trovald come into at that exact moment and threaten to shoot
      everyone. And that is both how nuclear war was averted and Linux
      became the most popular operating system on the planet.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Most beginners will get really confused at this stage, and try to
      randomly pick one. Or they will pick something that sounds sexy
      and cool, but is practically useless. Something stupid like
      assembly language or Haskell. They will struggle with it for some
      time, and then give up. A large number of you will just quit at
      this stage.</p>
    <p>The whole process may seem frustrating and irritating: Why are
      there so many programming languages, and how do you choose? What
      if you make the wrong choice? You may spend years studying
      something, only to find it went out of date six years ago.
      Agghhhh!</p>
    <p>No wonder people feel so tense. Before we go any further, let me
      say just one thing: No time spent studying a language will be
      wasted. Even if it was Basic from the 80s, or even Logo, every
      minute will be useful.<br>

    <h3>Programming is a tool </h3>
    <p>The way out of this conundrum is to remember this: <b><i>Programming


          is a tool.</i></b><br>
    </p>
    <p>Most people get so enamored with the tool, they forget it's just
      a thing you use to solve a problem. Do people who study carpentry
      spend hours debating if they should use a hammer or a screwdriver?<br>
    </p>
    <p>So the first question to ask yourself is: What do you want to
      accomplish? Because what tool you use will depend on what you want
      to accomplish. There are a few typesof programming languages,
      depending on what you want to accomplish:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&nbsp;<b>Low Level languages</b>: Used when writing operating
        systems, compilers, embedded systems; anything that must be
        close to the hardware. C and C++ are the only two languages used
        nowadays, though C is more common.</li>
      <li><b>Application languages</b>: This is software that runs on
        the computer. C# ( &amp; the related Microsoft languages like
        Visual Basic), Java, C++.&nbsp; This is what most people think
        when they think of programming-- programs like MS Office that
        run on your PC. As I will say in a later post, these type of
        programs are no longer as important as they were.</li>
      <li><b>Web Based languages</b>: Used for developing applications
        that run on the web. In addition to Javascript and Php, this may
        include scripting languages like Python and Ruby.</li>
      <li><b>Scripting languages</b>: Used for testing, rapid
        prototyping, these languages have some very powerful features.
        So much so that they are being used for almost everything under
        the sun. From web development, to games to scientific computing.
        Again, Python is a great example.<br>
      </li>
      <li><b>Games</b>: Everything from C++ to Javascript can be used
        for this. See more below.</li>
      <li><b>Pretentious languages</b>: We will discuss this in a future
        post. These are languages that the "elite" and "posh"
        programmers won't shut up about, like Haskell and Lisp. They are
        not useful in any practical application, but if you want to
        appear "leet", you have to pretend to be an expert in them.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>So the question to ask yourself is, what do you want to
      accomplish?<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <i><br>
    </i>1.<i> Want to write low level code for an embedded system? </i>Use

    C, maybe C++. Not assembly. No matter how cool you may have heard it
    is.
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <i>2. Want to write enterprise level code (that solves business
      problems)?</i> Remember, the people who slap and abuse you, force
    you to sit in a chair for 8 hours, and then throw you a few pieces
    of silver? Well, they are the ones who decide this. So shut up and
    go back to work.
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <i>3. Want to write games? </i>Which games?
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Games that run on your PC or on consoles like XBox- C++, C#</li>
        <li>Online games - Flash (try to avoid this), javascript. Maybe
          a scripting language like Python or Ruby.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    4<i>. </i><i>Web applications?</i> There is&nbsp; a group of
    languages you may have to learn. Javascript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl
    (though not all of them).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    If in doubt, choose Python. It is simple to learn, and easy to read.
    It is a well supported language, with plenty of tutorials and books.<br>
