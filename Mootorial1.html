    You are walking down the alley. It's late at night, and after a
    night of partying and clubbing, you are going home to your mansion,
    and your beautiful wife/husband. <br>
    <br>
    Just kidding.<br>
    <br>
    You live alone in a broken cockroach infested home, and you haven't
    been partying, you have been crying over your wasted life. You
    decide to take a short cut through a slightly shady part of town.
    "Who will rob me? I hain't got two pence to my name," you think to
    yourself (you a talk like a hillybilly, because you are a
    hillybilly; if it helps).<br>
    <br>
    That's when you hear and see a thunder flash. Sparks fly all around
    you, and you have to cover your eyes to protect them. When you open
    them, you see a naked cow kneeling in front of you. The cows says
    "Hello World!"<br>
    <br>
    Okay, open up your Python console, and type this:<br>
    <br>
    <code> &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello World!" <br>
      Hello World! </code> <br>
    <br>
    You should see "Hello World" printed on your screen. If you see
    "Kill them all, and burn down the house" instead, please stop
    reading immediately, and see your psychiatrist. Again. Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    The cow sees you, and starts walking towards you. Being the coward
    you are, you want to run away, but are too scared to. The cow walks
    right up to you.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello, I am the Moo-Inator. You are?"<br>
    Hello, I am the Moo-Inator. You are?<br>
    <br>
    You are too scared to say anything, and stare stupidly at the cow.
    So Moo-Inator repeats the question.<br>
    <br>
    To read user values in Python, the function is raw_input().
    Additionally, you can enter some text in the brackets. Try this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; raw_input("What is your name?")<br>
    What is your name? Geek<br>
    ' Geek'<br>
    <br>
    The Python console will ask your name. Whatever you enter will be
    printed on the next line. But that isn't good enough. We need to
    store the variable. <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input("What is your name?")<br>
    What is your name? Dr Underpants<br>
    <br>
    The name is now stored in the variable called <i>name</i>. Why
    would you do that? (Other than because I told you to?) Because you
    can use this variable.<br>
    <br>
    print "Hello " + name + "! How are you?"<br>
    Hello&nbsp; Dr Underpants! How are you?<br>
    <br>
    Python allows you to join strings using a simple '+' sign. In the
    example above, we joined "Hello" with the name you entered, and then
    "How are you?"<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Try it:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello " + "You" + "&nbsp;&nbsp; lalal"<br>
    'Hello You&nbsp;&nbsp; lalal'<br>
    <br>
    -----------------------<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    As you see the Moo-Inator walking towards you, you start shivering
    with fear (being the coward you are). You fall to the ground and
    start crying. Seriously, you are such a little girl. <br>
    <br>
    As soon as the cow comes near you, you fall to the ground, and start
    shivering in fear. You say, "Please don't kill me," five times.<br>
    <br>
    Just to humor me, type this 5 times.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    <br>
    That's a bit slow, isn't it, even for you? Surely, I hear you say,
    there must be a better way. Yes sir/ma'am, there is!<br>
    <br>
    Type this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; range(5)<br>
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
    <br>
    We are going to come back to this, so don't worry if you don't
    understand everything. The range() function returns a list of
    numbers. As you can see, they start from 0, for reasons too geeky to
    explain here.<br>
    <br>
    Do this now:<br>
    <br>
    for i in range(5):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    <br>
    A few things: Python is very, how can I say this politely, anal
    language. Python is your fat aunt Martha who wags her finger at you
    and asks you why you haven't made your bed, and how you will never
    amount to anything. Python is the skinny girl at your Yoga class
    lecturing you to eat more green. Python is the grammar nerd, telling
    you you used the word irony incorrectly. You get the idea. Python is
    really anal&nbsp; about whitespace. There are a few places you must
    use whitespaces, and I will tell you where. For those who know some
    programming, this is any loop, if condition, classes etc.&nbsp; So
    if you type this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    print "Please dont kill me"<br>
    &nbsp; File "&lt;pyshell#4&gt;", line 2<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Please dont kill me"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^<br>
    IndentationError: expected an indented block<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    That is Python moaning you did not use enough whitespace. So you
    must have a few empty spaces on the second line. Like this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    &lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;print "Please dont kill me"<br>
    <br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    <br>
    The Moo-Inator offers you its hand. "Caam weethe mee, eef you waaant
    tu leeeve," it says in a heavy Austrian accent. Oh my God, you
    think. The cow is from Austria. You can trust it then. Austrians
    cows have never killed anyone, to your knowledge, and you see no
    reason to doubt all that stuff you have read on the internets.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Chap 2??<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    "Who are you?" you ask.<br>
    <br>
    "Why, I am a cow, of course," says the Moo-Inator. "I come from the
    future. Zombie bankers have destroyed&nbsp; &lt;&lt;add story.
    chosen one like hp. must save the future using power of python. He
    is a geek.&gt;&gt;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    "We need to find all the greedy bankers in the country. Do you know
    them?"<br>
    <br>
    You look at the cow like its gone crazy. "You jokin' right?"<br>
    <br>
    But the cow is serious. "Surely there can be no more than a dozen
    greedy bankers in the country?"<br>
    <br>
    You shake your head and wonder what century the cow is from. "There
    are ten thousand greedy bankers in this city alone."<br>
    <br>
    "Tell me the names of a few of them."<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Right folks. Coding time. You need to take five names from the user.
    Because&nbsp; a talking cow from the future told you. Seriously,
    when did you last visit your psychiatrist? <br>
    <br>
    So, let me show you how not to do it:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; raw_input("Please enter name 1")<br>
    Please enter name 1Jackass<br>
    'Jackass'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; raw_input("Please enter name 2")<br>
    Please enter name 2Greedy Pig<br>
    'Greedy Pig'<br>
    <br>
    That's a bit tiring, isn't it? Try this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList = []<br>
    <br>
    nameList is now an&nbsp; empty list. We will store our names in it.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name =
    raw_input("Please enter name: ")<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
    nameList.append(name)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Please enter name: Jackass<br>
    Please enter name: Greedy Pig<br>
    Please enter name: 1Banker1<br>
    Please enter name: Some Dude<br>
    Please enter name: KILLER QUEEN<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Again, remember to ident the code below the for loop. Let's go over
    the lines one by one. Feel free to skip if you have done programming
    before, and know what a for loop is.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    <br>
    The for loop allows us to run the same code multiple times. We have
    already seen the range() function, which generates&nbsp; a range of
    numbers from 0 to 4 (hence five numbers). The for loop says we need
    to run the code below 5 times. The ‘i’ is just a variable. You can
    call it anything. LoopCounter, Pizzas, or CowDung. Don’t believe me?

    <p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px;
      margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Yes sir,

    <p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px;

    <p style=" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px;
      margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;">Yes sir,

      margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px;
      -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br>
    </p>
    The actual variable can be used, as we will see later. Coming back
    to our code, the second line :<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name =
    raw_input("Please enter name: ")<br>
    <br>
    We already know what this is. We are reading the name from the user,
    and storing it in a variable called name.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
    nameList.append(name)<br>
    <br>
    Remember the list called nameList we created? It was empty to start
    with. We now add the name we just read to it. Once you are done with
    the names, you can print them out:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList<br>
    ['Jackass', 'Greedy Pig', '1Banker1', 'Some Dude', 'KILLER QUEEN']<br>
    <br>
    Of course, that isn't the proper way to print names. It only works
    because we are in a debug shell. If this was live code, this might
    not work. The proper way to print the names is:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for name in nameList:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print name<br>
    <br>
    Jackass<br>
    Greedy Pig<br>
    1Banker1<br>
    Some Dude<br>
    KILLER QUEEN<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for name in nameList:<br>
    <br>
    name is a variable we are using. Again, we could call it anything.
    This loop says, for each name stored in nameList,<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print name<br>
    <br>
    Print that name.<br>
    <br>
    Your turn. Type this code in, and enter five names. Just make sure
    the third name is "1Banker1", and the last name is in ALL CAPS.<br>
    <br>
    There are many ways to work with our list. I have shown you one way
    (using a for loop) above. But you can also access each element. Our
    list contains five names. As I said earlier, in Python, the numbers
    start from zero. So the first name is at position zero in the list.
    What does that mean? Type this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[0]<br>
    'Jackass'<br>
    <br>
    So if we want to see the second name, we have to type<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[1]<br>
    'Greedy Pig'<br>
    <br>
    Let's look at the last name now.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[4]<br>
    'KILLER QUEEN'<br>
    <br>
    This is in all caps, which is considered shouting. Well, why don't
    we fix it? Python gives us several inbuilt tools to work with
    strings.<br>
    <br>
    Side Note: What's a string?<br>
    <br>
    In Python, string is a type of a variable, usually used to store
    names, addresses etc. Anything declared with quotes, " or ', becomes
    a string.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "This is a string"<br>
    'This is a string'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'So is this'<br>
    'So is this'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; Not a string<br>
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
    <br>
    In the last example, Python is complaining because we have not
    enclosed the sentence within quotes (" "), so Python thinks its an
    instruction, and tries to execute it.<br>
    <br>
    String is the most popular type in Python, and used a lot.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Coming back to our example, we could manually fix our all caps, but
    why should we, when Python will do that for us? There are a large
    number of inbuilt functions for strings, and we will use them
    instead:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[4].lower()<br>
    'killer queen'<br>
    <br>
    The lower() function converts a string to lower case. We can call it
    on any string.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "I AM ALL CAPS"<br>
    'I AM ALL CAPS'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "I AM NOT CAPS".lower()<br>
    'i am not caps'<br>
    <br>
    But lower case isn't good enough for us. Most names have the first
    word capitalised. I wonder if that is possible?<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[4].title()<br>
    'Killer Queen'<br>
    <br>
    Now we got it. The title() function converts string to the proper
    format for names, so the first letter is capital. How do we update
    the array? Simples.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[4] = nameList[4].title()<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList<br>
    ['Jackass', 'Greedy Pig', '1Banker1', 'Some Dude', 'Killer Queen']<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We still have a problem. Our middle name has extra '1's in it, that
    we typed in by mistake. Luckily, we can remove it easily:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "1banker1".strip("1")<br>
    'banker'<br>
    <br>
    The strip() function is actually used to remove whitespace. Imagine
    you read a name from a file:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr James T
    Sharphorn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br>
    '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr James T Sharphorn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br>
    <br>
    There is a lot of space of the beginning and end of the name,&nbsp;
    which we don't want to store. Strip will strip the space for us. By
    default, the strip() function removes empty space:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr James T
    Sharphorn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ".strip()<br>
    'Mr James T Sharphorn'<br>
    <br>
    The only problem is that strip() only works at the start and end of
    the string. So if you had "ban1ker", it would not work. There are
    other ways around that, which we will see later.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>A string is also a list</b><br>
    <br>
    This may come across as a surprise to you, unless you started
    programming in the 60s, and look like this:<br>
    <br>
    &lt;Kernigham foto&gt;<br>
    <br>
    Due to historical reason, a string is also a list. What does that
    mean? Let's look at our original list:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for name in nameList:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print name<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Jackass<br>
    Greedy Pig<br>
    1Banker1<br>
    Some Dude<br>
    Killer Queen<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This is how you print a list, as we have seen. But we can do the
    same for a string.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myName = "I am Henry the Eight I am!"<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myName<br>
    'I am Henry the Eight I am!'<br>
    <br>
    So far, so good.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for n in myName:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print n<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    I<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    a<br>
    m<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    H<br>
    e<br>
    n<br>
    r<br>
    y<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    t<br>
    h<br>
    e<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    E<br>
    i<br>
    g<br>
    h<br>
    t<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    I<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    a<br>
    m<br>
    !<br>
    <br>
    As you can see, Python treats your string as a list, and allows you
    to print each character individually. This will come in useful
    later.<br>
