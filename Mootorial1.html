    You are walking down the alley. It's late at night, and after a
    night of partying and clubbing, you are going home to your mansion,
    and your beautiful wife/husband. <br>
    <br>
    Just kidding.<br>
    <br>
    You live alone in a broken cockroach infested home, and you haven't
    been partying, you have been crying over your wasted life. You
    decide to take a short cut through a slightly shady part of town.
    "Who will rob me? I hain't got two pence to my name," you think to
    yourself (you a talk like a hillybilly, because you are a
    hillybilly; if it helps).<br>
    <br>
    That's when you hear and see a thunder flash. Sparks fly all around
    you, and you have to cover your eyes to protect them. When you open
    them, you see a naked cow kneeling in front of you. The cows says
    "Hello World!"<br>
    <br>
    Okay, open up your Python console, and type this:<br>
    <br>
    <code> &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello World!" <br>
      Hello World! </code> <br>
    <br>
    You should see "Hello World" printed on your screen. If you see
    "Kill them all, and burn down the house" instead, please stop
    reading immediately, and see your psychiatrist. Again. Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    The cow sees you, and starts walking towards you. Being the coward
    you are, you want to run away, but are too scared to. The cow walks
    right up to you.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello, I am the Moo-Inator. You are?"<br>
    Hello, I am the Moo-Inator. You are?<br>
    <br>
    You are too scared to say anything, and stare stupidly at the cow.
    So Moo-Inator repeats the question.<br>
    <br>
    To read user values in Python, the function is raw_input().
    Additionally, you can enter some text in the brackets. Try this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; raw_input("What is your name?")<br>
    What is your name? Geek<br>
    ' Geek'<br>
    <br>
    The Python console will ask your name. Whatever you enter will be
    printed on the next line. But that isn't good enough. We need to
    store the variable. <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input("What is your name?")<br>
    What is your name? Dr Underpants<br>
    <br>
    The name is now stored in the variable called <i>name</i>. Why
    would you do that? (Other than because I told you to?) Because you
    can use this variable.<br>
    <br>
    print "Hello " + name + "! How are you?"<br>
    Hello&nbsp; Dr Underpants! How are you?<br>
    <br>
    Python allows you to join strings using a simple '+' sign. In the
    example above, we joined "Hello" with the name you entered, and then
    "How are you?"<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Try it:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello " + "You" + "&nbsp;&nbsp; lalal"<br>
    'Hello You&nbsp;&nbsp; lalal'<br>
    <br>
    <br>
