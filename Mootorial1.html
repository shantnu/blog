  <body>
    You are walking down the alley. It's late at night, and after a
    night of partying and clubbing, you are going home to your mansion,
    and your beautiful wife/husband. <br>
    <br>
    Just kidding.<br>
    <br>
    You live alone in a broken cockroach infested home, and you haven't
    been partying, you have been crying over your wasted life. You
    decide to take a short cut through a slightly shady part of town.
    "Who will rob me? I hain't got two pence to my name," you think to
    yourself (you a talk like a hillybilly, because you are a
    hillybilly; if it helps).<br>
    <br>
    That's when you hear and see a thunder flash. Sparks fly all around
    you, and you have to cover your eyes to protect them. When you open
    them, you see a naked cow kneeling in front of you. The cows says
    "Hello World!"<br>
    <br>
    Okay, open up your Python console, and type this:<br>
    <br>
    <code> &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello World!" <br>
      Hello World! </code> <br>
    <br>
    You should see "Hello World" printed on your screen. If you see
    "Kill them all, and burn down the house" instead, please stop
    reading immediately, and see your psychiatrist. Again. Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    The cow sees you, and starts walking towards you. Being the coward
    you are, you want to run away, but are too scared to. The cow walks
    right up to you.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello, I am the Moo-Inator. You are?"<br>
    Hello, I am the Moo-Inator. You are?<br>
    <br>
    You are too scared to say anything, and stare stupidly at the cow.
    So Moo-Inator repeats the question.<br>
    <br>
    To read user values in Python, the function is raw_input().
    Additionally, you can enter some text in the brackets. Try this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; raw_input("What is your name?")<br>
    What is your name? Geek<br>
    ' Geek'<br>
    <br>
    The Python console will ask your name. Whatever you enter will be
    printed on the next line. But that isn't good enough. We need to
    store the variable. <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input("What is your name?")<br>
    What is your name? Dr Underpants<br>
    <br>
    The name is now stored in the variable called <i>name</i>. Why
    would you do that? (Other than because I told you to?) Because you
    can use this variable.<br>
    <br>
    print "Hello " + name + "! How are you?"<br>
    Hello&nbsp; Dr Underpants! How are you?<br>
    <br>
    Python allows you to join strings using a simple '+' sign. In the
    example above, we joined "Hello" with the name you entered, and then
    "How are you?"<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Try it:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello " + "You" + "&nbsp;&nbsp; lalal"<br>
    'Hello You&nbsp;&nbsp; lalal'<br>
    <br>
    -----------------------<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    As you see the Moo-Inator walking towards you, you start shivering
    with fear (being the coward you are). You fall to the ground and
    start crying. Seriously, you are such a little girl. <br>
    <br>
    As soon as the cow comes near you, you fall to the ground, and start
    shivering in fear. You say, "Please don't kill me," five times.<br>
    <br>
    Just to humor me, type this 5 times.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    <br>
    That's a bit slow, isn't it, even for you? Surely, I hear you say,
    there must be a better way. Yes sir/ma'am, there is!<br>
    <br>
    Type this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; range(5)<br>
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
    <br>
    We are going to come back to this, so don't worry if you don't
    understand everything. The range() function returns a list of
    numbers. As you can see, they start from 0, for reasons too geeky to
    explain here.<br>
    <br>
    Do this now:<br>
    <br>
    for i in range(5):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    <br>
    A few things: Python is very, how can I say this politely, anal
    language. Python is your fat aunt Martha who wags her finger at you
    and asks you why you haven't made your bed, and how you will never
    amount to anything. Python is the skinny girl at your Yoga class
    lecturing you to eat more green. Python is the grammar nerd, telling
    you you used the word irony incorrectly. You get the idea. Python is
    really anal&nbsp; about whitespace. There are a few places you must
    use whitespaces, and I will tell you where. For those who know some
    programming, this is any loop, if condition, classes etc.&nbsp; So
    if you type this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    print "Please dont kill me"<br>
    &nbsp; File "&lt;pyshell#4&gt;", line 2<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Please dont kill me"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^<br>
    IndentationError: expected an indented block<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    That is Python moaning you did not use enough whitespace. So you
    must have a few empty spaces on the second line. Like this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    &lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;print "Please dont kill me"<br>
    <br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    <br>
    The Moo-Inator offers you its hand. "Caam weethe mee, eef you waaant
    tu leeeve," it says in a heavy Austrian accent. Oh my God, you
    think. The cow is from Austria. You can trust it then. Austrians
    cows have never killed anyone, to your knowledge, and you see no
    reason to doubt all that stuff you have read on the internets.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Chap 2??<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    "Who are you?" you ask.<br>
    <br>
    "Why, I am a cow, of course," says the Moo-Inator. "I come from the
    future. Zombie bankers have destroyed&nbsp; &lt;&lt;add story.
    chosen one like hp. must save the future using power of python. He
    is a geek.&gt;&gt;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    "We need to find all the greedy bankers in the country. Do you know
    them?"<br>
    <br>
    You look at the cow like its gone crazy. "You jokin' right?"<br>
    <br>
    But the cow is serious. "Surely there can be no more than a dozen
    greedy bankers in the country?"<br>
    <br>
    You shake your head and wonder what century the cow is from. "There
    are ten thousand greedy bankers in this city alone."<br>
    <br>
    "Tell me the names of a few of them."<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Right folks. Coding time. You need to take five names from the user.
    Because&nbsp; a talking cow from the future told you. Seriously,
    when did you last visit your psychiatrist? <br>
    <br>
    So, let me show you how not to do it:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; raw_input("Please enter name 1")<br>
    Please enter name 1Jackass<br>
    'Jackass'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; raw_input("Please enter name 2")<br>
    Please enter name 2Greedy Pig<br>
    'Greedy Pig'<br>
    <br>
    That's a bit tiring, isn't it? Try this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList = []<br>
    <br>
    nameList is now an&nbsp; empty list. We will store our names in it.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name =
    raw_input("Please enter name: ")<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
    nameList.append(name)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Please enter name: Jackass<br>
    Please enter name: Greedy Pig<br>
    Please enter name: 1Banker1<br>
    Please enter name: Some Dude<br>
    Please enter name: KILLER QUEEN<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Again, remember to ident the code below the for loop. Let's go over
    the lines one by one. Feel free to skip if you have done programming
    before, and know what a for loop is.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    <br>
    The for loop allows us to run the same code multiple times. We have
    already seen the range() function, which generates&nbsp; a range of
    numbers from 0 to 4 (hence five numbers). The for loop says we need
    to run the code below 5 times. The ‘i’ is just a variable. You can
    call it anything. LoopCounter, Pizzas, or CowDung. Don’t believe me?

      -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"><br>
    </p>
    The actual variable can be used, as we will see later. Coming back
    to our code, the second line :<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name =
    raw_input("Please enter name: ")<br>
    <br>
    We already know what this is. We are reading the name from the user,
    and storing it in a variable called name.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
    nameList.append(name)<br>
    <br>
    Remember the list called nameList we created? It was empty to start
    with. We now add the name we just read to it. Once you are done with
    the names, you can print them out:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList<br>
    ['Jackass', 'Greedy Pig', '1Banker1', 'Some Dude', 'KILLER QUEEN']<br>
    <br>
    Of course, that isn't the proper way to print names. It only works
    because we are in a debug shell. If this was live code, this might
    not work. The proper way to print the names is:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for name in nameList:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print name<br>
    <br>
    Jackass<br>
    Greedy Pig<br>
    1Banker1<br>
    Some Dude<br>
    KILLER QUEEN<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for name in nameList:<br>
    <br>
    name is a variable we are using. Again, we could call it anything.
    This loop says, for each name stored in nameList,<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print name<br>
    <br>
    Print that name.<br>
    <br>
    Your turn. Type this code in, and enter five names. Just make sure
    the third name is "1Banker1", and the last name is in ALL CAPS.<br>
    <br>
    There are many ways to work with our list. I have shown you one way
    (using a for loop) above. But you can also access each element. Our
    list contains five names. As I said earlier, in Python, the numbers
    start from zero. So the first name is at position zero in the list.
    What does that mean? Type this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[0]<br>
    'Jackass'<br>
    <br>
    So if we want to see the second name, we have to type<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[1]<br>
    'Greedy Pig'<br>
    <br>
    Let's look at the last name now.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[4]<br>
    'KILLER QUEEN'<br>
    <br>
    This is in all caps, which is considered shouting. Well, why don't
    we fix it? Python gives us several inbuilt tools to work with
    strings.<br>
    <br>
    Side Note: What's a string?<br>
    <br>
    In Python, string is a type of a variable, usually used to store
    names, addresses etc. Anything declared with quotes, " or ', becomes
    a string.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "This is a string"<br>
    'This is a string'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'So is this'<br>
    'So is this'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; Not a string<br>
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax<br>
    <br>
    In the last example, Python is complaining because we have not
    enclosed the sentence within quotes (" "), so Python thinks its an
    instruction, and tries to execute it.<br>
    <br>
    String is the most popular type in Python, and used a lot.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Coming back to our example, we could manually fix our all caps, but
    why should we, when Python will do that for us? There are a large
    number of inbuilt functions for strings, and we will use them
    instead:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[4].lower()<br>
    'killer queen'<br>
    <br>
    The lower() function converts a string to lower case. We can call it
    on any string.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "I AM ALL CAPS"<br>
    'I AM ALL CAPS'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "I AM NOT CAPS".lower()<br>
    'i am not caps'<br>
    <br>
    But lower case isn't good enough for us. Most names have the first
    word capitalised. I wonder if that is possible?<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[4].title()<br>
    'Killer Queen'<br>
    <br>
    Now we got it. The title() function converts string to the proper
    format for names, so the first letter is capital. How do we update
    the array? Simples.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList[4] = nameList[4].title()<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; nameList<br>
    ['Jackass', 'Greedy Pig', '1Banker1', 'Some Dude', 'Killer Queen']<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We still have a problem. Our middle name has extra '1's in it, that
    we typed in by mistake. Luckily, we can remove it easily:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "1banker1".strip("1")<br>
    'banker'<br>
    <br>
    The strip() function is actually used to remove whitespace. Imagine
    you read a name from a file:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr James T
    Sharphorn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br>
    '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr James T Sharphorn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '<br>
    <br>
    There is a lot of space of the beginning and end of the name,&nbsp;
    which we don't want to store. Strip will strip the space for us. By
    default, the strip() function removes empty space:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr James T
    Sharphorn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ".strip()<br>
    'Mr James T Sharphorn'<br>
    <br>
    The only problem is that strip() only works at the start and end of
    the string. So if you had "ban1ker", it would not work. There are
    other ways around that, which we will see later.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>A string is also a list</b><br>
    <br>
    This may come across as a surprise to you, unless you started
    programming in the 60s, and look like this:<br>
    <br>
    &lt;Kernigham foto&gt;<br>
    <br>
    Due to historical reason, a string is also a list. What does that
    mean? Let's look at our original list:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for name in nameList:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print name<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Jackass<br>
    Greedy Pig<br>
    1Banker1<br>
    Some Dude<br>
    Killer Queen<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    This is how you print a list, as we have seen. But we can do the
    same for a string.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myName = "I am Henry the Eight I am!"<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; myName<br>
    'I am Henry the Eight I am!'<br>
    <br>
    So far, so good.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for n in myName:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print n<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    I<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    a<br>
    m<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    H<br>
    e<br>
    n<br>
    r<br>
    y<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    t<br>
    h<br>
    e<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    E<br>
    i<br>
    g<br>
    h<br>
    t<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    I<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    a<br>
    m<br>
    !<br>
    <br>
    As you can see, Python treats your string as a list, and allows you
    to print each character individually. This will come in useful
    later.<br>

    "Say, what's wrong with Donkey? I can hear him braying."<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sentence.find("Donkey")<br>
    23<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sentence[23]<br>
    'D'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; sentence[23:]<br>
    'Donkey? I can hear him braying.'<br>
    <br>
    As we can see, strings work just like arrays.<br>
    <br>
    Dictionary<br>
    <br>
    Reach the top, find the thing computer code locked. Open up code
    book<br>
    <br>
    There is a special kind of a list called a dictionary. A dictionary
    has a key and a value. A bit like a normal dictionary. What does it
    mean? Let's try an example. <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; code_book = {'code 1':'password', 'code 2':'idontknow',
    'code 3':'abcdef'}<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; code_book<br>
    {'code 1': 'password', 'code 3': 'abcdef', 'code 2': 'idontknow'}<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; code_book['code 1']<br>
    'password'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
    <br>
    The general format of a dictionary is:&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    dict = { 'key 1': 'value 1', 'key 2': 'value 2'}<br>
    <br>
    Where key1 points to value1, and so on. Why would you want to do
    that? There are cases when two things are linked, and you want to
    store both of them together. A very common example is user names and
    passwords.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; code_book = { 'user1':'pass1', 'user2':'pass2',
    'user3':'pass3'}<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; code_book<br>
    {'user2': 'pass2', 'user3': 'pass3', 'user1': 'pass1'}<br>
    <br>
    Here, user 1 has the password pass1, user 2 has password pass2, and
    so on. So if you want to see the password for user1, you would type:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; code_book['user1']<br>
    'pass1'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; code_book['user3']<br>
    'pass3'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; code_book['code 2']<br>
    'idontknow'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; code_book['code 3']<br>
    'abcdef'<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Conditions<br>
    <br>
    The if command allows you to run your code if only certain
    conditions are fulfilled. Eg,<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; number = 1<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if number == 1:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Number is 1"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Number is 1<br>
    <br>
    Thing to note: The difference between '=' and '=='.<br>
    <br>
    '=' says, this value equal to that. In the example above, number is
    equal to 1.<br>
    <br>
    '==' does a comparison. It checks: Is this equal to that? In your
    Python window, type this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 == 1<br>
    True<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; 1 == 2<br>
    False<br>
    <br>
    '==' returns true of false, as we see above.<br>
    <br>
    The if command works by checking this condition. In our example, it
    checks if number is equal to 1. Since it is the first time around,
    it prints "Number is 1".<br>
    <br>
    The if command can also have an else command, that is run if the
    condition isn't true:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; number = 2<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if number == 1:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Number is 1"<br>
    else:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Number is not 1"<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Number is not 1<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You can also have something called an else if, shortened to elif in
    Python:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if number == 1:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Number is 1"<br>
    elif number == 2:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Number is 2"<br>
    else:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Number is not 1 or 2"<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Number is 2<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Now, it checks the first condition. If it is not true, it checks the
    second condition. If both aren't true, it will fall to the last
    condition. Try the code with number = 3.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; number = 3<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if number == 1:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Number is 1"<br>
    elif number == 2:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Number is 2"<br>
    else:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Number is not 1 or 2"<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Number is not 1 or 2<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; enemy = "orc"<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if enemy == "orc":<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "The power of pizza compels you!"<br>
    else:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Sorry, my mistake"<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The power of pizza compels you!<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; enemy = "lawyer"<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; if enemy == "orc":<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "The power of pizza compels you!"<br>
    else:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Sorry, my mistake"<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Sorry, my mistake.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Now what do you do if you are surrounded by a bunch of enemies?
    Create a list with random enemies thrown in:<br>
    <br>
    enemy = ["orc", "nerd", "lawyer", "nerd", "lawyer", "orc",
    "secretary"]<br>
    <br>
    Make it random, just be sure to add a secreatary in there somewhere.
    Now we need to loop over this list.<br>
    <br>
    for e in enemy:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if e == "orc":<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "The power of pizza
    compels you!"<br>
    <br>
    The for loop must be familiar by now.&nbsp; The next line may
    require an explanation. The for loop goes over each element in the
    list, and calls it 'e' (in my example).<br>
    <br>
    It then checks: Is the current value equal to orc, and if it is, it
    will print our message. Of course, we need to do this for all the
    enemies. And don't forget the secretary- we don't want to kill her.
    I will show you how to deal with her as well. Here is the complete
    code:<br>
    <br>
    enemy = ["orc", "nerd", "lawyer", "nerd", "lawyer", "orc",
    "secretary"]<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for e in enemy:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if e == "orc":<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "The power of pizza
    compels you!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elif e =="nerd":<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "I am a Master of Visual
    Cobol dot Net!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elif e == "lawyer":<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "No, I DO NOT agree to
    your Terms and Conditions. I am a Lol Cat Fan!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Sorry to bother you.
    See ya!"<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The power of pizza compels you!<br>
    I am a Master of Visual Cobol dot Net!<br>
    No, I DO NOT agree to your Terms and Conditions. I am a Lol Cat Fan!<br>
    I am a Master of Visual Cobol dot Net!<br>
    No, I DO NOT agree to your Terms and Conditions. I am a Lol Cat Fan!<br>
    The power of pizza compels you!<br>
    Sorry to bother you. See ya!<br>
    <br>
    This is a good time to introduce functions. If you are going to
    repeat a lot of code, it makes sense to put it in a function. This
    makes your code easy to read and follow. So if you get bored of
    fighting eemies, just call this function. Let's call it
    Just_Deal_With_Them().<br>
    <br>
    def Just_Deal_With_Them(e):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if e == "orc":<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "The power of pizza
    compels you!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elif e =="nerd":<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "I am a Master of Visual
    Cobol dot Net!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elif e == "lawyer":<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "No, I DO NOT agree to
    your Terms and Conditions. I am a Lol Cat Fan!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Sorry to bother you.
    See ya!"<br>
    <br>
    def is the command that tells Python you are declaring a function.
    Anything in the brackets () is what you are passing in; in this
    case, the enemy name. To show how this function is used:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for e in enemy:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just_Deal_With_Them(e)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    The power of pizza compels you!<br>
    I am a Master of Visual Cobol dot Net!<br>
    No, I DO NOT agree to your Terms and Conditions. I am a Lol Cat Fan!<br>
    I am a Master of Visual Cobol dot Net!<br>
    No, I DO NOT agree to your Terms and Conditions. I am a Lol Cat Fan!<br>
    The power of pizza compels you!<br>
    Sorry to bother you. See ya!<br>
    <br>
    As you can see, the code is much simpler now. Let's see another
    example. If you remember, we used the lower() and title() functions?
    What if we get a list of names in ALL CAPS, and want to change them
    to normal?<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def Normal_Case(name):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return name.title()<br>
    <br>
    The new thing is the return- functions can return a value. In this
    case, it takes a capital name, and returns the title version of it.
    Try it out:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; Normal_Case("THIS IS A NAME IN ALL CAPS")<br>
    'This Is A Name In All Caps'<br>
    <br>
    How do we use this in practice? Say we have a list of names in all
    caps, and we want to copy the names to a new list:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; names = ["JOHN", "BARRY", "SOMEGUY"]<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; names_small = []<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for n in names:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; names_small.append(Normal_Case(n))<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print names_small<br>
    ['John', 'Barry', 'Someguy']<br>
    <br>
    We declare an empty list called names_small. We then loop over the
    names. This line requires an explanations:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; names_small.append(Normal_Case(n))<br>
    <br>
    We are calling a function within a function. append() is a function
    that adds values to a Python list. In that, we are calling our own
    function Normal_Case. Normal_Case returns the normal version of the
    names, which are pased to names_small.append(), which adds the names
    to the list. The final result is, we get a new list with our names
    fixed.<br>
    Defeating all the nerds and orcs stopping your way, you make it to
    the top, to find the door is blocked by a code. (Dict code here).<br>
    <br>
    ----<br>
    <br>
    &lt;goto iceland. just when about to throw stapler, Doogynator turns
    up and attacks. Moo injured, gives you BFG 9000 Elder Wand (Made in
    China). Doogy fires attacks at you.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The Doggy-Inator starts firing attacks at you. <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; doggy_attacks = [10, 10, 20, 7, 30]<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; your_health = 100<br>
    <br>
    doggy_attacks is a list which contains the amount of damage his
    attacks will do to you. You start off with a health of 100.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Your health is %d" % (your_health)<br>
    Your health is 100<br>
    <br>
    This is a form of the print statement. "%d" tells that you want to
    print a decimal (or a number). After the % symbol, you give the
    actual number you want to print. The most common symbols are %d for
    numbers and %s for strings. Another example:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Mr %s is %d years old" % ("Jack", 21)<br>
    Mr Jack is 21 years old<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, so the Doggy-Nator fires his attacks at you:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; doggy_attacks = [10, 10, 20, 7, 30]<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Your health is %d" % (your_health)<br>
    Your health is 100<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for d in doggy_attacks:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your_health -= d<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Your health is %d" % (your_health)<br>
    Your health is 23<br>
    <br>
    your_health -= d <br>
    <br>
    The -= command means, subtract the value, and store it in the
    current variable. So this line means, take your current health, and
    subtract d (where d is the damage) from it. The overall effect is,
    your health goes down each time. To understand this better, print
    out your health each time:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; your_health = 100<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for d in doggy_attacks:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your_health -= d<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "After getting damage %d, your health falls
    to %d" % (d, your_health)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    After getting damage 10, your health falls to 90<br>
    After getting damage 10, your health falls to 80<br>
    After getting damage 20, your health falls to 60<br>
    After getting damage 7, your health falls to 53<br>
    After getting damage 30, your health falls to 23<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Oh oh. You just lost 77% of your health. You can't survive like this
    for long. Luckily, you are wearing Plot Armor. For those of you who
    don't know what this is, Plot Armor is special protection the writer
    of the book/movie gives to the hero, so the hero always survives any
    blast, or a thousand bullets fired at him. That's why the Storm
    Troopers can fire a thousand bullets at Skywalker, and still miss.
    The real truth is, they didn't miss; he was wearing Plot Armor. Just
    like you are now. So instead of you, the Moo-Inator is hurt.<br>
    <br>
    "No!" you cry out. "Please don't die."<br>
    <br>
    "Don't worry. According to the script, I don't die until scene 57."
    <br>
    <br>
    He gives you his super secret weapon, the BFG 9000 Elder Wand (Made
    in China). "Use this, it will cancel out Doggy-Inators attacks."<br>
    <br>
    Now we will come to one of the most powerful techniques in Python:
    List Comprehension. First, you need to weaken the Doggy's attacks,
    using your BFG thingy.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; weak_attacks = []<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for d in doggy_attacks:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak_attacks.append(d / 10)<br>
    <br>
    We have created a new variable with the weakened attacks,
    imaginatively called weak_attacks.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; doggy_attacks<br>
    [10, 10, 20, 7, 30]<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; weak_attacks<br>
    [1, 1, 2, 0, 3]<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    Now, let's see what happens when the Doggy-Inator attacks us.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for weaken in weak_attacks:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your_health -= weaken<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Your health is %d" % (your_health)<br>
    Your health is 93<br>
    <br>
    See what we did? We created a variable weaken, and used it to weaken
    the Doggy-Inator's attacks ten times. So instead of causing us 77%
    damage, they only caused us 7%.<br>
    <br>
    The key thing was that we ran a separate for loop to reduce the
    power of the attacks. Specifically, this one:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for d in doggy_attacks:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak_attacks.append(d / 10)<br>
    <br>
    Python gives us a very powerful method to do this is a single line,
    called list comprehension.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; weak_attacks = [x / 10 for x in doggy_attacks]<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; weak_attacks<br>
    [1, 1, 2, 0, 3]<br>
    <br>
    This will require some explanation. List comprehensions are used
    when we are working with lists. One of the most common tasks is to
    take a list, do something with it, and create a new list. Because
    this is so common, an easy way to do this was created, rather than
    having to loop all the time.<br>
    <br>
    [x / 10 for x in doggy_attacks]<br>
    <br>
    This is the whole instruction. First, as you may know, lists are
    created by using the [] brackets. But in this case, we have put
    instructions in the [ ].<br>
    <br>
    The simplest way to understand list comprehension is, <br>
    <br>
    [ &lt;instruction&gt;&nbsp; for variable in list]<br>
    <br>
    Python will automatically loop over the list, and run the
    &lt;instruction&gt; each time. In our example:<br>
    <br>
    [x / 10 <b>for x in doggy_attacks</b>]<br>
    <br>
    First, it will loop over doggy_attacks, and use the variable x.<br>
    <br>
    [<b>x / 10</b> for x in doggy_attacks]<br>
    <br>
    The instruction here is x / 10. So that for each variable in the
    list, Python will divide it by 10. Since the whole command is
    in&nbsp; [ ], it will automatically create a list for you. Which is
    why<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; weak_attacks = [x / 10 for x in doggy_attacks]<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; weak_attacks<br>
    [1, 1, 2, 0, 3]<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    returns a list.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    ---<br>
    <br>
    Battle going with Doggy-Nator, but he cancelling your attacks. Way
    to beat him is to use the magic words, "Ipso facto Deus Ex Machinia,
    Attack number 21!!", but the Doggy-Inator won't let you finish your
    sentences, as he cancels your attack. 21 is the secret number, the
    Dues Ex weakness you fond out using your special Chosen One powers.
    Here is a function to defeat the Doggy:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def super_attack(secret_number):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Begin Super secret attack!"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Ipso facto Deus Ex Machinia, Attack number
    %d!" % (secret_number)<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; super_attack(21)<br>
    Begin Super secret attack!<br>
    Ipso facto Deus Ex Machinia, Attack number 21!<br>
    <br>
    All you need to do is call the function super_attack with 21, and
    that will defeat the enemy. If only the Doggy-Inator would let you.<br>
    <br>
    The last topic we will study is another very powerful and cool one.
    Python allows you to create code in real time. Here's how.<br>
    <br>
    The Doggy-Inator won't allow you to say&nbsp; "Ipso facto Deus Ex
    Machinia, Attack number 21!" How about if we trick it?<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We will assemble our secret attack in (no surprise), secret.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = "super"<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; b = "_"<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; c = "attack("<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; secret_number = 21<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; d= str(secret_number)<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; e = ")"<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; secret_command = a + b +c +d +e<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print secret_command<br>
    super_attack(21)<br>

    Okay, some recap. As you may remember, we can add strings with a +.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello" + "World"<br>
    HelloWorld<br>
    <br>
    The only other thing you may not know is the str() function. It
    takes a number, and converts it to a string.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; str(21)<br>
    '21'<br>
    <br>
    The final effect is that the string secret_command contains the
    secret function we must call. But how do we call it? If we try to
    call it directly, the Doggy-Inator cancels our attack?<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print secret_command<br>
    super_attack(21)<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; eval(secret_command)<br>
    Begin Super secret attack!<br>
    Ipso facto Deus Ex Machinia, Attack number 21!<br>
    <br>
    The eval is one of the coolest commands in Python, as it allows you
    to create a Python command at run time. You pass it a string, and
    eval will run it like a Python command.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = 10<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; eval("a * 2")<br>
    20<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    In our example, we created&nbsp; a string that contains our
    function.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; secret_command = a + b +c +d +e<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print secret_command<br>
    super_attack(21)<br>
    <br>
    Now we run this command using the eval function. It will call the
    function super_attack(21) for us.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; eval(secret_command)<br>
    Begin Super secret attack!<br>
    Ipso facto Deus Ex Machinia, Attack number 21!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    And there we go! Enemy defeated.<br>
