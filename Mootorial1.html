    You are walking down the alley. It's late at night, and after a
    night of partying and clubbing, you are going home to your mansion,
    and your beautiful wife/husband. <br>
    <br>
    Just kidding.<br>
    <br>
    You live alone in a broken cockroach infested home, and you haven't
    been partying, you have been crying over your wasted life. You
    decide to take a short cut through a slightly shady part of town.
    "Who will rob me? I hain't got two pence to my name," you think to
    yourself (you a talk like a hillybilly, because you are a
    hillybilly; if it helps).<br>
    <br>
    That's when you hear and see a thunder flash. Sparks fly all around
    you, and you have to cover your eyes to protect them. When you open
    them, you see a naked cow kneeling in front of you. The cows says
    "Hello World!"<br>
    <br>
    Okay, open up your Python console, and type this:<br>
    <br>
    <code> &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello World!" <br>
      Hello World! </code> <br>
    <br>
    You should see "Hello World" printed on your screen. If you see
    "Kill them all, and burn down the house" instead, please stop
    reading immediately, and see your psychiatrist. Again. Thank you.<br>
    <br>
    The cow sees you, and starts walking towards you. Being the coward
    you are, you want to run away, but are too scared to. The cow walks
    right up to you.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Hello, I am the Moo-Inator. You are?"<br>
    Hello, I am the Moo-Inator. You are?<br>
    <br>
    You are too scared to say anything, and stare stupidly at the cow.
    So Moo-Inator repeats the question.<br>
    <br>
    To read user values in Python, the function is raw_input().
    Additionally, you can enter some text in the brackets. Try this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; raw_input("What is your name?")<br>
    What is your name? Geek<br>
    ' Geek'<br>
    <br>
    The Python console will ask your name. Whatever you enter will be
    printed on the next line. But that isn't good enough. We need to
    store the variable. <br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; name = raw_input("What is your name?")<br>
    What is your name? Dr Underpants<br>
    <br>
    The name is now stored in the variable called <i>name</i>. Why
    would you do that? (Other than because I told you to?) Because you
    can use this variable.<br>
    <br>
    print "Hello " + name + "! How are you?"<br>
    Hello&nbsp; Dr Underpants! How are you?<br>
    <br>
    Python allows you to join strings using a simple '+' sign. In the
    example above, we joined "Hello" with the name you entered, and then
    "How are you?"<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Try it:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello " + "You" + "&nbsp;&nbsp; lalal"<br>
    'Hello You&nbsp;&nbsp; lalal'<br>
    <br>
    -----------------------<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    As you see the Moo-Inator walking towards you, you start shivering
    with fear (being the coward you are). You fall to the ground and
    start crying. Seriously, you are such a little girl. <br>
    <br>
    As soon as the cow comes near you, you fall to the ground, and start
    shivering in fear. You say, "Please don't kill me," five times.<br>
    <br>
    Just to humor me, type this 5 times.<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    Please don't kill me<br>
    <br>
    That's a bit slow, isn't it, even for you? Surely, I hear you say,
    there must be a better way. Yes sir/ma'am, there is!<br>
    <br>
    Type this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; range(5)<br>
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
    <br>
    We are going to come back to this, so don't worry if you don't
    understand everything. The range() function returns a list of
    numbers. As you can see, they start from 0, for reasons too geeky to
    explain here.<br>
    <br>
    Do this now:<br>
    <br>
    for i in range(5):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; print "Please don't kill me"<br>
    <br>
    A few things: Python is very, how can I say this politely, anal
    language. Python is your fat aunt Martha who wags her finger at you
    and asks you why you haven't made your bed, and how you will never
    amount to anything. Python is the skinny girl at your Yoga class
    lecturing you to eat more green. Python is the grammar nerd, telling
    you you used the word irony incorrectly. You get the idea. Python is
    really anal&nbsp; about whitespace. There are a few places you must
    use whitespaces, and I will tell you where. For those who know some
    programming, this is any loop, if condition, classes etc.&nbsp; So
    if you type this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    print "Please dont kill me"<br>
    &nbsp; File "&lt;pyshell#4&gt;", line 2<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "Please dont kill me"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^<br>
    IndentationError: expected an indented block<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    That is Python moaning you did not use enough whitespace. So you
    must have a few empty spaces on the second line. Like this:<br>
    <br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(5):<br>
    &lt;space&gt;&lt;space&gt;print "Please dont kill me"<br>
    <br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    Please dont kill me<br>
    <br>
    The Moo-Inator offers you its hand. "Caam weethe mee, eef you waaant
    tu leeeve," it says in a heavy Austrian accent. Oh my God, you
    think. The cow is from Austria. You can trust it then. Austrians
    cows have never killed anyone, to your knowledge, and you see no
    reason to doubt all that stuff you have read on the internets.<br>

    Chap 2??<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    "Who are you?" you ask.<br>
    <br>
    "Why, I am a cow, of course," says the Moo-Inator. "I come from the
    future. Zombie bankers have destroyed <br>
