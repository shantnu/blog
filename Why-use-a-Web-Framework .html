      <h1>Why use a Web Framework?</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    You might be wondering why you need a web framework at all? After
    all, it just adds complexity and bureaucracy. You are a uber-nerd.
    If you want a web framework, you can write you own, dammnit!<br>
    <br>
    <h2>How hard can it be to write your own framework?</h2>
    <p>It's simple, isn't it? You need a login mechanism? Simple, you
      make your own. Including your own encryption function:<br>
    </p>
    <p><tt>def encrypt(input):</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password = random_garbage +
        input + more_random_garbage</tt></p>
    <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do_some_magic(password)</tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt><tt><br>
      </tt><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password = password + "kitty"&nbsp; #
        Add the word 'kitty' to the end of the password, to make it
        harder to hack</tt><tt><br>
      </tt></p>
    <p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return password</tt><br>
    </p>
    <pre><code>summon_cthulhu();</code></pre>
    <p><br>
      There you go. A perfect, unhackable system, especially if you keep
      the code secret. (If you didn't get the joke, I'm referencing this
      post:
      http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/25585/is-my-developers-home-brew-password-security-right-or-wrong-and-why).


      Except my scheme is better, because I add kitties to the password,
      to make it even more unhackable.<br>

        <b>Databases</b><br>
        <br>
        What databases? They are a pain in the rear end. Just a simple
        text file. Or two files. Usernames.txt and passwords.txt. Your
        passwords are already kitty-protected, so it's not like you can
        be hacked or anything?<br>
        <br>
        <h2>Reasons to use a web framework</h2>
        <p>Frameworks provide you with several useful features:<br>
        </p>
        <p>1. Url redirection: So that when the user goes to <i>yourwebsite.com/kitty</i>,
          the server knows it must run the script<i> kitty.py</i>.</p>
        <p>2. Authentication: A simple way to determine if users have
          logged in. May also allow you to set cookies, so you can <s>spam
            you users</s> show them meaningful and spiritual ads that
          will enrich their lives.<br>
        </p>
        <p>3. Support for databases: At the minimum, you will have a
          database of usernames, right?<br>
        </p>
        <p>4. Security: Framework designers know most of the security
          attacks, and will have build safeguards in the framework.
          There might still be holes, but as long as the framework is
          open source, you know they will be found and fixed (someday).<br>
        </p>
        <p><br>
        </p>
        <h2>The real problem with frameworks</h2>
        <p>So lets come to the real problem you don't use frameworks:
          They are big, bloated, ugly and very hard to use (I'm looking
          at you Django. I recently read a long tutorial, at the end of
          which the author said 'Now you can understand the official
          Django tutorial').<br>
        </p>
        <p>Not only are many frame works hard to start with, they have a
          lot of baggage and "magic". If you want to do anything even
          slightly different from the "approved" way, you have to jump
          through a lot of hoops, and go digging into the dark innards
          of the documentation, written for version 0.01, and never
          updated since. You might wonder, why is this done this way?
          The answer is, usually, cause they say so. And you can't blame
          the designers. In many cases, they are aware of the problems.
          But due to historical reasons, and backward compatibility, you
          are stuck with the decisions made by someone sitting drunk in
          his underwear (isn't that how most web frameworks and
          programming languages designed? I dare you to prove me wrong).<br>
        </p>
        <p>But it doesn't have to be this way. You don't need to use
          huge ugly frameworks. Instead, you can use micro
          frameworks,&nbsp; which allow you to bring in what you need,
          rather than what someone five years ago thought you might need
          today. In Python, the most famous micro framework is Flask. In
          a later blog, I will look at Flask vs Django.<br>
