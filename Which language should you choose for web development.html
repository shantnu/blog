<h1 align="center">Which language should you choose for web
development</h1>
<br>
Back in the dark ages, when dinosaurs roamed the earth, and cavemen
pulled their women by the hair, we still programmed our webpages in
C. Yes, I know it is a manly language, and anyone who has hair on
his chest (or even her chest), should know how to program in C. <br>
<br>
So if you wanted to see an image of a partially naked lady, you
would write your own damn web client/server, implement your own
TCP/IP stack, get it running with a remote server, and then wait
only twenty five minutes while a grainy image of a woman in a bikini
came to your screen, pixel by pixel. Which is why when I hear about
these kids gushing about how cool Ruby on Rails is, I want to give
them a wedgie. <br>
<br>
Anyway, a prophet called Larry Wall came to Earth to civilise us
humans. Verily, he said unto us, you do not have to write a complete
webserver in C every time you want to view naughty images. But his
ideas were too radical, and he was burnt as a heretic. [editor:
citation needed].<br>
<br>
Anyway, we are out of those dark times, and now live in modern
enlightened times where every teenager can view as many image of
women in bikinis (ahem, because teenagers are law abiding citizens,
and would never click on the I'm over 18 button falsely, so they
only view tasteful images).<br>
<br>
So in these civilized times, if you want to write web based apps,
you need to know three main things:<br>
<br>
1. <i>HTML/CSS</i>- Yes, you do need to have some basic knowledge
of these, even though you may be a "programming ninja", or whatever
is the "cool" term all startups use. You know, on those ads on
Stackoverflow, saying, "We need a Python ninja,":<br>

Which to me seems they want a cross dressing Japanese, who will go
around murdering people using the python snake<br>
