    <h1 align="center">Which language should you choose for web
      development?</h1>
    <br>
    Back in the dark ages, when dinosaurs roamed the earth, and cavemen
    pulled their women by the hair, we still programmed our webpages in
    C. Yes, I know it is a manly language, and anyone who has hair on
    his chest (or even her chest), should know how to program in C. <br>
    <br>
    So if you wanted to see an image of a partially naked lady, you
    would write your own damn web client/server, implement your own
    TCP/IP stack, get it running with a remote server, and then wait
    only twenty five minutes while a grainy image of a woman in a bikini
    came to your screen, pixel by pixel. Which is why when I hear about
    these kids gushing about how cool Ruby on Rails is, I want to give
    them a wedgie. <br>
    <br>
    Anyway, a prophet called Larry Wall came to Earth to civilise us
    humans. Verily, he said unto us, you do not have to write a complete
    webserver in C every time you want to view naughty images. But his
    ideas were too radical, and he was burnt as a heretic. [editor:
    citation needed].<br>
    <br>
    Anyway, we are out of those dark times, and now live in modern
    enlightened times where every teenager can view as many image of
    women in bikinis (ahem, because teenagers are law abiding citizens,
    and would never click on the<i> I'm over 18 button</i> falsely).<br>
    <br>
    So in these civilized times, if you want to write web based apps,
    you need to know three main things:<br>
    <br>
    1. <i>HTML/CSS</i>- Yes, you do need to have some basic knowledge
    of these, even though you may be a "programming ninja", or whatever
    is the "cool" term all startups use. You know, on those ads on
    Stackoverflow, saying, "We need a Python ninja,":<br>
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img alt="Image of medieval Japanese assasin"
        src="Yamato_Takeru_at_16-crop.jpg" height="316" width="243"><br>
      <i> Which to me seems they want a cross dressing Japanese, who
        will go around murdering people using the python snake</i><br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">2. <i>Client side languages</i> - Client here
        doesn't mean shady men who hang around in shady neighborhoods
        looking for illegal stuff. No, client here means code that runs
        in the web browser. The most popular language here is Javascript
        and jquery. Client languages are needed because talking to the
        server is very expensive (in terms of time). It's faster to do
        small things (like checking if the email address is valid, or
        password format is correct) right in the user's web browser,
        using something like Javascript.<br>
        <br>
        Note, some people will tell you that Flash (from Adobe) is also
        a programming language. My advice is, take such people out and
        shoot them. Adobe, the creators of flash, are actually a secret
        terrorist group run by psychotic aliens. My evidence: They try
        to get you to install spyware and "anti-virus" tools every time
        you try to update flash. <br>
        <br>
        3. <i>Back end languages</i> - These languages talk to your
        back end code(or may be your back end code). Back end means they
        do stuff like talk to databases, authenticate users, perform
        calculations, talk to aliens etc. The core of your app.<br>
        <br>
        For a long time, PHP was&nbsp; the most popular language in the
        domain, and it still is. However, it is widely seen [editor:
        reference needed][screw you, editor] as a clunky, ugly and
        insecure. In the last few years, other languages like Python and
        Ruby have taken over, especially with their web frameworks like
        Ruby on Rails and Django.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>So I haven't answered my question: Which language should you
          use?</h3>
        <p><br>
          It depends on which you are comfortable with. If you know
          Ruby, choose Ruby on Rails. If you know Python, choose Django,
          Flask or something similar. Just don't use PHP or Java.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>But you still haven't told me which language to use!<br>
        </h3>
        <p><i>Sigh</i>. Just use Python, okay. Now go bother someone
          else.<br>
        </p>
