    <h1 align="center">Python is your frumpy uncle Fred</h1>
    <p><b>Summary</b>: In which I try to show, via a confusing and
      rambling story, that Python is the underdog of the programming
      world-- it does a lot of work, but is ignored because it isn't
      sexy enough.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Your uncles come to dinner</b></p>
    <p>So, it's that night again. All you uncles are coming to dinner
      tonight, and your mother has dressed you up, and asked you to
      behave yourself. It's dinner time, and you sit at the table and
      try to act nice.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The first to come in is your uncle Perl. He is wearing a black
      t-shirt and jeans, and even though he is starting to bald, he has
      taken the few strands of hair he has left and tied them into a
      pony tail. Right behind him is Ruby, your youngest uncle. He is
      wearing the latest fashionable clothes from HipsterDressingCo, and
      looks like a TV star. Ruby is working on his iPhone, and barely
      nods at you. Right behind him is Coldfusion. Finally, your mom
      brings in PHP, and ties a bib around his neck. He promptly tries
      to eat his fork.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The last to come in is your frumpy uncle Fred. He is wearing a
      bad pressed coat, and it looks like he hasn't slept much. "Sorry
      I'm late, everyone. Lot of work at the office."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"That's okay," says your mom. "You work too hard, Python." She
      serves the food, and everyone starts eating. Everyone except for
      Ruby, who is playing with his phone.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Ruby," says your mom, a little exasperated, "the food will get
      cold."<br>
    </p>
    <p>Ruby makes a face. "Sorry, but I don't have time for such small
      things as eating. At the startup where I work, we often work right
      thru the night. It's the coolest company in the world. We are
      making widgets that will used to display dancing monkey ads for
      social media plugins in community driven networked devices, while
      providing SEO optimisation at the same time. Yeah, you see, we are
      really cutting edge. So cool, aren't we?"<br>
    </p>
    <p>Everyone ignores him. "Hey, do you want to hear me say how cool I
      am ten more times?" says Ruby, and proceeds to do just that for
      the next five minutes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Hey Ruby, you know what would be cool?" says Perl. "You actually
      making enough money to pay for the food you eat."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Ha. Paying rent is so 90s. Hey, know what I'll do? I'll write a
      blog and do a podcast on how cool I am."<br>
    </p>
    <p>Perl rolls his eyes. "Kids. Wait till all those hip startup types
      turn forty, and go work for BigBoringCorp. Let's see how hip you
      are then." He turns to your mom. "Hey, this food has gotten cold.
      Can I microwave it?"<br>
    </p>
    <p>"No!" Your mom snatches the plate from him. "You are banned from
      using the microwave, remember?"<br>
    </p>
    <p>You look around, confused. "Why is uncle Perl banned from the
      microwave?"<br>
    </p>
    <p>Python laughs. "Cause the last time he got near one, he turned it
      into a time vortex manipulation device, and almost blew up the
      planet. So he's not allowed near any radiation device now. The
      president has personally ordered it. Perl has a habit of tinkering
      with everything he works with, and since he is messy and
      forgetful, he usually forgets what he was doing and ends up
      blowing stuff a lot."<br>
    </p>
    <p>Coldfusion is sitting sad, so you ask him what's wrong. "Nothing.
      No one loves me."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"That's not true, Cold."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"It is. I was hip for exactly three weeks in 1999."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, but you got enough big corporations interested in you,
      didn't you? Now they are stuck paying you thousands of dollars
      every month."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Maybe. But I'd like to be hip again."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"We all would," says Python. He rubs his bald spot. "I wish I was
      young and cool again, but I have to pay the bills now. Can't spend
      all my time blogging how cool I am."<br>
    </p>
    <p>You nod. You realise that it's your uncles Perl and Python who
      are paying the rent and bills in the house, though all they get is
      contempt. Perl is seen as messy and dangerous, while Python is
      seen as old and boring, though they both aren't that old.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There is a scream, and everyone turns to PHP. He has been trying
      to shove a fork up his nose. Your mom comes and stops him.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Sad," says your uncle Python. "We would send him to the
      hospital, but he brings in a large amount of money."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Really?" you ask, a bit surprised.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Yes. Thousands of programmers and websites use him, because he
      was once considered easy to use, and was the default supported
      language on many servers. So even though he is mentally unsound,
      often behaves strangely, gets drunk and runs around naked on the
      street, we keep him, because all those programmers would be very
      angry if we got rid of him."<br>
    </p>
    <p>PHP is talking to himself again. "After I've finished eating, I
      will go and see Miss MySql."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"No!" your mom shouts out. "You know you aren't allowed to see
      her, or any other lady from the Database Academy, after what you
      did to her last time. They have a restraining order."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"What did he do?" you ask, but Python shushs you.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"We don't talk about it. It was something that brought us a lot
      of embarrassment. Let's just say Miss MySql will have problems
      getting married now."<br>
    </p>
    <p>The dinner is over, and everyone is leaving. Python thanks
      everyone, and says he has work to do. You walk your uncles out,
      and wish them all goodnight. As they are all leaving, you see Bash
      and Dos Batch File running to the house.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Did we miss the dinner?" they ask. "We got left behind."<br>
    </p>
