    <h1 align="center">Python is your frumpy uncle Fred</h1>
    <p><b>Summary</b>: In which I try to show, via a confusing and
      rambling story, that Python is the underdog of the programming
      world-- it does a lot of work, but is ignored because it isn't
      sexy enough.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Your uncles come to dinner</b></p>
    <p>So, it's that night again. All you uncles are coming to dinner
      tonight, and your mother has dressed you up, and asked you to
      behave yourself. It's dinner time, and you sit at the table and
      try to behave yourself.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The first to come in is your uncle Perl. He is wearing a black
      t-shirt and jeans, and even though he is starting to bald, he has
      taken the few strands of hair he has left and tied them into a
      pony tail. Right behind him is Ruby, your youngest uncle. Ruby is
      working on his iPhone, and barely nods at you. Right behind him is
      Coldfusion. Finally, your mom brings in PHP, and ties a bib around
      his neck. He promptly tries to eat his fork.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The last to come in is your frumpy uncle Fred. He is wearing a
      bad pressed coat, and it looks like he hasn't slept much. "Sorry
      I'm late, everyone. Lot of work at the office."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"That's okay," says your mom. "You work too hard, Python." She
      serves the food, and everyone starts eating. Everyone except for
      Ruby, who is playing with his phone.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Ruby," says your mom, a little exasperated, "the food will get
      cold."<br>
    </p>
    <p>Ruby makes a face. "Sorry, but I don't have time for such small
      things as eating. At the startup where I work, we often work right
      thru the night. It's the coolest company in the world. We are
      making widgets that will used to display dancing monkey ads for
      social media plugins for SEO optimisation in community driven
      networked devices. Yeah, you see, we are really cutting edge. So
      cool we are?"<br>
    </p>
    <p>Everyone ignores him. "Hey, do you want to hear me say how cool I
      am ten more times?" said Ruby, and proceeded to do just that for
      the next five minutes.<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Hey Ruby, you know what would be cool? You actually making
      enough money to pay for the food you eat."<br>
    </p>
    <p>"Ha. Paying rent is so 90s. Hey, know what Ill do? I'll write a
      blog and do a podcast."<br>
    </p>
    <p>Perl rolls his eyes. "Kids." He turns to your mom. "Hey, this
      food has gotten cold. Can I microwave it?"<br>
    </p>
    <p>"No!" Your mom snatches the plate from him. "You are banned from
      using the microwave, remember?"<br>
    </p>
    <p>You look around, confused. "Why is uncle Perl banned from the
      microwave?"<br>
    </p>
    <p>Python laughs. "Cause the last time he got near one, he turned it
      into a time vortex manipulation device, and almost blew up the
      planet. So he's not allowed near any radiation device now. The
      president has ordered it."<br>
